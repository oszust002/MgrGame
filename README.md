In this game you are space commander who have to destroy space pirates invading your universe.

There are few types of enemies which are spawned in waves. On every level there is different enemy wave pattern, for each of them you gain points, which you have to gain certain amount to get to next level. In some conditions you can start hard mode for 10 seconds where enemy pattern changes to harder versions of enemies and spawn rate of enemies increases.

In the game you can also collect power ups which can give you different weapon or some health.
